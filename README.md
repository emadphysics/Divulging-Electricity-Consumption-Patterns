# Divulging-electricity-consumption-patterns
In this investigation we will analyze past 5 years of hourly electricity consumption data of countries: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, The Netherlands, Spain and Swiss in Europe to find trends in energy consumption around hour of the day, day of the week, month of the year and compare electricity consumption patterns and building state-of-the-art predictive model to forecast the electricity consumption in the Netherlands. So our objective is to identify which factors and input parameters will be the most relevant for forecasting energy consumption. Furthermore, we are identifying which forecasting models will show the best performance for our time series data. The developed forecasting models can be utilized by the electrical utilities to effectively plan their energy generation operations and balance their customers energy demand, and avoiding any excess generation of energy.
